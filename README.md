# AGE_ESTIMATION_PROJECT
Personal project for predicted age using Tensorflow, Keras, base on research paper. Using Mean-Variance Loss and Softmax Loss to predict age.

In this project, I build a model base on ResNet-34 architecture.

# DATASET
The dataset i'm using is FG-NET dataset, which has 1002 images of people between 0-69 years old.
